# Fleet-Dashboard-Design
• Created a 10-page dashboard (KPI Summary, Labor & Cost, Vehicles dashboard, etc.) for the Fleet Services team
on the UC Davis campus to help manage/analyze maintenance, repair, inspection, and reporting of
on-campus vehicles (https://github.com/sanab123/Fleet-Dashboard)
• Reported metrics such as average fleet cost (w/fuel) per mile, % vehicles overdue for replacing, etc
• Maintained dashboard to integrate high data update frequency, most useful pages, and missing KPI categories
